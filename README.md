# Spectral Hyperresolution

This repository brings [Sparse time-frequency representations](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0601707103) by Timothy J. Gardner and Marcelo O. Magnasco to the Python world.

To quote the paper:

> Many details of complex sounds that are virtually undetectable in standard sonograms are readily perceptible and visible in reassignment

The idea we would like to explore is the application of the novel linear reassignment technique to downstream tasks (audio classification, unsupervised machine translation, etc). The hope is that this richer representation can lead to improved performance.

To observe the high resolution linear reassignment can achieve, please click on the image below and zoom in.

### Special thanks

I would like to extend my gratitude to Marcelo O. Magnasco, the discoverer of linear reassignment. He has been extremely kind and patient to explain to me the behavior of linear reassingment and to share his code. His help is what made the work in this repository possible.
